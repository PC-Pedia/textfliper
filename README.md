# TextFliper
If you're a Persian speaker you might have experienced that when you try to export a PDF file into something else the Persian text broke and there is no software available to fix this problem. This software however is a try to fix the broken Persian texts. You can see it's working good.<br>

### Features
- Adobe saves same characters in different Unicode forms. the software detects different forms and replaces them with the standard one.
- Adobe saves characters left-to-right English way. Persian texts however must be right-to-left so the software takes care of this part.
